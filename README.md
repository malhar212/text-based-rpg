# Dungeons

## Overview
Dungeons is dungeon game that creates a maze of caves and tunnels and starts off a player at the start cave.\
Player can navigate through the maze collecting any treasures in the caves along the way or picking up arrows.\
Player can shoot the arrows to kill monsters they encounter along the way\
There will always be a monster at the end cave.

## List of Features
1. Player can collect treasure.
2. Player can collect arrows.
3. Players can move in NORTH, SOUTH, EAST, WEST direction if the cave has those directions open.
4. Player can shoot an arrow in the directions that are available from the current location.
5. Player can kill a monster(Otyugh).

## How to run
1. Make sure java is installed on the system.
2. Navigate to the directory where the jar file is stored using terminal.
3. Run command `java -jar Project4.jar 5 4 true 5 50 3`
4. Where command arguments are `java -jar Project3.jar rows columns wrapped interconnectivity treasureAndArrowPercentage numberOfMonsters`
5. `rows` integer number of rows of dungeon maze.
6. `columns` integer number of columns of the dungeon maze.
7. `wrapped` boolean for maze wrapped around edges or not.
8. `interconnectivity` integer interconnectivity of the maze.
9. `treasureAndArrowPercentage` integer percentage of caves to be filled with treasure and percentage of all locations to be filled with arrows.
10. `numberOfMonsters` number of monsters in the dungeon. Even if number of monsters passed is 0 there will be a monster at the end.

## How to use Program
The game can be played by following instructions as provided on the screen.\

Common controls are to enter the corresponding alphabet irrespective of case\
MOVE: M SHOOT: S PICKUP: P QUIT: Q\
You can input N for North, E for East, S for South, W for West\
for the command you want to perform.

The Dungeon interface is the main model of game.\
To create a new Dungeon:
```
Randomizer randomizer = new GameRandomizer();
Dungeon dungeon = new DungeonModel(rows,columns,wrapped,
interconnectivity,treasureAndArrowPercentage,numberOfMonsters, randomizer);
```

To create a DungeonController to interact with the game:
```
DungeonController controller = new DungeonConsoleController(
            new InputStreamReader(System.in), System.out);
```
In the above example we're using System.in as the input source and System.out as the output appendable.

To start the game:
```
controller.play(dungeon);
```
To get startLocation of dungeon:
```
Location startLocation = dungeon.getStartLocation();
```

To get endLocation of dungeon:
```
Location endLocation = dungeon.getEndLocation();
```

To get player current Location of dungeon:
```
Location playerCurrentLocation = dungeon.getPlayerCurrentLocation();
```

Next moves available from current location:
`Set<Move> nextMoves = dungeon.getAvailableMoves();`

To move player:\
`movePlayer(move);`

To check if current location has treasure:
```
Location playerCurrentLocation = dungeon.getPlayerCurrentLocation();
playerCurrentLocation.hasTreasure();
```

To pick treasure at the location\
`dungeon.playerPickTreasure()`

We can use `Player player = dungeon.getPlayerDescription();` to get info about player.
Details of a player can be obtained by:
```
boolean hasTreasure = player.hasTreasure();
Map<Treasure, Integer> treasure = player.getTreasure();
```

## Design Changes
The following changes were made to the previous design: 
1. Added Command Pattern related interface and classes.//TODO
2. Added enum Commands for easier validation all command to be taken from user input.
3. Added enum ArrowHitOutcome.
4. Some changes to method name and return types.

## Assumptions
The following assumptions were made:
1. Player is instantiated inside Dungeon model.
2. On pickup command all items of a type will be picked up.
3. Arrows can only be fired at a distance of 1-5.
4. Even if number of monsters passed is 0 there will be a monster at the end.

## Limitations
1. Players cannot set their player names due to requirement of the project.
2. Next location cannot be fetched without moving to that location.
3. Arrows can only be fired at a distance of 1-5.
